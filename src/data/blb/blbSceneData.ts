    post: "The ferocious thorny porcupine shudders and dissipates into a massive coil of prickly vines. The Oakhollow residents emerge with brooms and dustpans, rakes, and threshing scythes to help clear the debris, all the while singing your praises!",

    post: "The bees have buzzed their last, and as the cloud of pollen dissipates, the residents of the village emerge from their homes, eyes red with allergens and tears of gratitude. You're starting to make a name for yourselves among the villages of Bloomburrow!",
